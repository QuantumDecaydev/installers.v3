**Reporting Issues with the Google Search Appliance Connectors**

For customers who qualify for enterprise-level support, Google
provides support for the Google Search Appliance Connectors. You can
go to [Google for Work support information](http://www.google.com/support/enterprise/go/gsa_support)
for instructions on how to contact Google for Work Support.

For unsupported issues, such as using the connectors without a Google Search
Appliance, working with the source code, or to report problems with
unsupported development builds, you can file an issue on the code site.
Please look on the
[project home page](http://code.google.com/p/googlesearchapplianceconnectors/)
for a link to the connector you are using. For problems with the installers, you can
[file an issue](http://code.google.com/p/googlesearchapplianceconnectors/issues/list)
on this code site. Google may not respond to every issue.
